# GNL- Get Next Line

Second Project at 42 Curricullum.

The idea is to write own function that will read given file line by line.

The tricky part is that the C built-in libraries and functions are not allowed, except for:
* read
* malloc
* free 

Only functions from own Library LIBFT can be used.

As per Project's Objectives:

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
#static variables.
You will also gain a deeper understanding of:
* allocations, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory
* the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer
* the unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.


get_next_line returns -1, 0, 1 depending on wether an error has occurred, the reading has been completed or a line has been read respectively.
